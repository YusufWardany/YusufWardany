# Hi there, I'm [Yusuf Wardany] 👋

## 🛡️ Blue Teamer | Incident Response Intern @ DEPI
### 🏗️ Computer Engineering Student | 🚩 CTFs • INE • TryHackMe • Cyber Warfare Labs

> **"Leveraging Offensive Knowledge to Build Resilient Defenses."**

---

### 🛑 "To catch a hacker, you must think like one—but analyze like an engineer."

I am a **Blue Team Analyst** and **Computer Engineering undergraduate** with a unique edge: I build defenses based on a deep understanding of offensive tactics. My background in **Red Teaming** and **Bug Bounty hunting** allows me to anticipate attack vectors, while my engineering education grounds my analysis in system internals.

### 🧠 The Engineering Advantage
Unlike typical analysts, I don't just look at logs; I investigate the underlying architecture.

* **Operating Systems (CSE233):** Understanding memory anomalies, process scheduling, and kernel-level threats.
* **Computer Networks (CSE261):** Analyzing packet structures, TCP/IP handshakes, and network protocols at a fundamental level.
* **Cryptography (CSE242):** Identifying encryption flaws and understanding secure communication failures.
* **Digital Signal Processing (ELE432):** Applying signal processing principles to filter noise from legitimate security alerts.

---

### 🔭 Current Mission
As an **Incident Response Intern at DEPI**, I am bridging the gap between theory and practice.
* **Operations:** Monitoring SIEM environments and triaging alerts.
* **Lifecycle:** Participating in the full incident lifecycle (Preparation, Detection, Analysis, Containment).
* **Training:** Actively training on **INE's eCIR and eCHTP** tracks to master Threat Hunting and Advanced Incident Response.
