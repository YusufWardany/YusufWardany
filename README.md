# Hi there, I'm [YOUR NAME] 👋
## 🛡️ Blue Team Analyst | Computer Engineering Student | Incident Response Intern @ DEPI

> **"Leveraging Offensive Knowledge to Build Resilient Defenses."**

I am a **Computer Engineering undergraduate** and **Incident Responder** bridging the gap between low-level system understanding (OS, Networks) and modern security operations. My approach combines engineering rigor with an adversarial mindset to detect advanced threats and automate defense mechanisms.
